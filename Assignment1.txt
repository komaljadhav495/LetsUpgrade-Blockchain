Q.1) What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans: Blockchain is highly secured,cronologically ordered block that contains information to be stored along with the Hash value of previous block. 
          Blockchain is decentralized. 
          The main aim of Blockchain is to reduce the update and delete operations on data to achieve high security.
          Blockchain implements distributed database to allow multiple user to access it and cryptography to generate the hash value by using SHA-256, MD-5,etc algorithms. 

Q.2) What is the core problem Blockchaing trying to sovle?
Ans: The problem related to Authenticity and Security.

Q.3) What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
Ans: -Tamperproof : No one would be able to perform any manipulation operation on existing block.
          -Immutable : Block can not be able to modify.
          -Verifiable : Verified by all the blocks.
          -Transparent : Any change is made will reflect immediately.
          -Decentralized : Not controlled by any centralized system. Each block is important.

Q.4) What all things does Block contain?
Ans: -Block number.
          -Data to be stored.
          -Hash value of immediate preceded block.
          -Signature mining key.

Q.5)How is the Verifiability of Blockchain is attained?
Ans: The verifiability in blockchain is achieves by using the Hash value.
          Every block contains the hash value of pervious block so if the data or block is tampered then the hash value changes.
          By acknowledging the difference we can find which block is tampered along the entire chain of block.
